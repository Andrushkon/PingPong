    <h1 id="title" style="float: none;">ABOUT US</h1>
    <p id="aboutustext">
        Of course there will be competitions in other sports, but we are more interested in ping pong competitions. That's why we would like to be a very competitive ping-pong club and be recognised by it.
        Our goal is to become one of the top local teams and win as many tournaments as we can.
        The pavilion is situated in Las Palmas of Gran Canaria. 
        If you are interested, we open every day at 09:00 to 21:00 except Sundays.<br>
        <strong>(FIRST DAY IS FREE)</strong>
